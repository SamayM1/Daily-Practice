The files I have uploaded contain very small playground codes that cover the basic topics of swift. 
There is also a tic tac toe game that I have coded inside the git. 

Some of the topics I have covered include Variables, constants, data types, operators, control flow statements, optionals, defining and calling functions, parameter passing, return values, function types.
It also includes object-oriented concepts like properties, methods, inheritance, protocols, and extensions.
