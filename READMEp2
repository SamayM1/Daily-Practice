In this next set of files I have worked on the implementation of the concepts learned from the first half of the class.
There are projects that I created that include the fundamentals of AI/ML, firebase, and other aspects of app development. 

One project that I created was a login screen and dashboard for my app idea of "ClientBridge", in this it allows the user to log into the app but requries a specific username and password to let them in.
Once they enter the right credentials, it will take them to the dashboard where they have the option to do other tasks.

Another cool project I coded was a ML algorithm to predict the breeds of cats and dogs. It displays a picture of a cat or dog and then lists breeds underneath with the percentage of confidence that it's the breed. 

I also connected my google firebase key to my swift code to allow for some extra functionailty. 

Overall, the main difference in my new uploads is the implentation of concepts learned in class into my projects.
